\section{Results}
% Confuction matrices (for both types of networks)
% Average classification rate and recall, precision and F1 measures per class (part VIII).
\section{Fold Perfomance}
%Figure of the average performance per fold for both types of networks (part IX)
\section{Implementation Details}
% Brief summary of implementation details (e.g., (e.g., how you performed cross-validation,
% how you classified each example based on %the 6 outputs, 
%anything that you think it is important in your system implementation);
\section{Questions}
%1. Discuss how you obtained the optimal topology and optimal values of network parameters. Describe the performance measure you %used (and explain why you preferred it over other measures) and the different topologies / parameters you experimented with.
%2. Explain what strategy you employed to ensure good generalisation ability of the networks and overcome the problem of %overfitting.
%3. In Part VIII you used the optimal parameters that you found in part VI to train your networks. However, there is a problem with this approach, the data you used for validation at some point will be used for testing in cross-validation. Can you explain why this a problem? Ideally how should you optimise the parameters in cross-validation?
%4. Is there any difference in the classification performance of the two different classification approaches. Discuss the advantages / disadvantages of using 6 single-outut NNs vs. 1 six-output NNs.
